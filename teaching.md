# Teaching and Outreach 

As a passionate educator, I have experience as both a teaching assistant and lead instructor at both the graduate and undergraduate level, as well as extensive K-12 outreach experience. Addtionally, I have expereince in program delevopment and Higher Ed adminsitration as an active member of the The University of Chicago Human Genetics DEI committee. My professional goal, whether it be in the classroom or boardroom, is to cultivate a future where *all* students have the opportunity to pursue a STEM education. 


## Teaching Experience

### Citizen Science Instructor at Bard College 

In 2022 I participated in the [Citizen Science Program](https://citizenscience.bard.edu/) at Bard College as a data science strand faculty member. For the duration of the intesive 2.5 week course I was the primary instructor for a class of 15 first year undergraduate students. The core curriculum focused on developing student's scientific literacy, covering everything from the production of scientific knowledge to science policy, education, and communication, through the lens of water. Alongside the core curriculum, I also taught and helped develop data science labs. Throughout these labs I taught my students, most of whom who had never programmed before, basic analysis-focused R and GIS programming and supervised their independent reseach projects. Seeing my students go from having never coded before to developing and testing their own hypotheses in the span of less than three weeks was one of the most rewarding experiences of my career.
