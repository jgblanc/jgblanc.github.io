## About Me

As a [PhD candidate](https://hgen.uchicago.edu/program/students/jennifer-blanc) in the Department of Human Genetics at the University of Chicago, I am an experienced computational biologist with expertise in statistical and population genetics. My research focuses on developing novel approaches that utilize genetic data to better understand complex trait variation across diverse human populations. I am excited about the possibilities of large-scale genetic and genomics data to improve human health and committed to the mission of increasing diversity and promoting equity in human genetics. Alongside reseach, I am a passionate educator with experience in both Higher Education and K-12 STEM outreach.
